# vim-navigations
*A browser addon for vim-style navigations*

If you're using vim a lot, you might have tried scrolling down by pressing j or switching to next tab by pressing gt. You are not alone :) 

## Installation

- [vim-navigations at Mozilla Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vim-navigations/)

## Features

- Supports h (left), j (bottom), k (up), l (right) navigations.
- Supports gg (to top) and Shift+g (to bottom) navigations.
- Supports gt (next tab) and gT (previous tab).
- Supports command repetition as in vim. 100j will scroll down 100 lines.

Note that {i}gt works as vim's gt. So 2gt means "go to the second tab" (the first tab's index is 1)

## Credits

- I first forked [autonome](https://github.com/autonome)'s [vimkeybindings](https://github.com/autonome/vimkeybindings). In fact, I've even created a pull request. But then the code changed so much and I created this repo to maintain it.
